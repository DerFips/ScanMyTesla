# ScanMyTesla

This repository is mostly meant for bug and issue tracking only. Feel free to report any issues here, 
feature requests are also welcome!

I would like to share my code here soon, in order to give back to the Tesla hacking & reverse engineering community.

- If you are a programmer or hacker, feel free to use the code for whatever project you like - especially port it to Raspberry Pi, IOS etc
- If you are a user, please consider buying the app from the Google Play Store, in order to help pay for some of the adapters, cables, computers, coke and beer that went into this project!
